  
  Throughout the experiment, you will be told to make your 

  decisions of room identity based on either the objects

  in the room or the spaciousness of the room. The

  instructions will look like either: 


			  Base decisions on rooms' OBJECTS

			  or

			  Base decisions on rooms' SPACIOUSNESS
			

  Make sure you do your best to base your decisions of room

  identity SOLELY on the given cue.
